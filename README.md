# Data-scraping
This script scrapes job listings from LinkedIn using Playwright and BeautifulSoup. It opens LinkedIn Jobs search results for a given keyword and location, extracts job titles, company names, locations, and application links, and stores them in a CSV file. The script runs headless, processes multiple pages, and saves raw HTML content for debugging.
